Credits:
- Available code has been written by Sooraj Bhat, see README_bhat.
- I found the code here: http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~xinl/demo/inpainting.html
  (Code not written by Bhat was removed)

Run
- Open matlab, change current directory
- Create the mex code by running
      mex bestexemplarhelper.c
- To test inpainting:
      [i1,i2,i3,c,d,mov] = inpaint('bungee0.png','bungee1.png',[0 255 0]);
      plotall;
      close all;
      movie(mov);

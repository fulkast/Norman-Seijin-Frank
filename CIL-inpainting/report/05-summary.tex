\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

The aim of a scientific paper is to convey the idea or discovery of
the researcher to the minds of the readers. The associated software
package provides the relevant details, which are often only briefly
explained in the paper, such that the research can be reproduced.
To write good papers, identify your key idea, make your contributions
explicit, and use examples and illustrations to describe the problems
and solutions.

Inpainting is a widely used technique to replace hidden, defective or unwanted areas of an image with content that is automatically inferred from the rest of the image. In this report we present a novel inpainting method that is based on sparse coding of image patches and that is extended by three components: 1., 2., 3. We will show that the approach proves to be fast and reliable and compare the method with existing methods.

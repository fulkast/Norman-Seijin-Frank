\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The aim of writing a paper is to infect the mind of your reader with
the brilliance of your idea~\cite{jones08}. 
The hope is that after reading your
paper, the audience will be convinced to try out your idea. In other
words, it is the medium to transport the idea from your head to your
reader's head. 
In the following
section, we show a common structure of scientific papers and briefly
outline some tips for writing good papers in
Section~\ref{sec:tips-writing}.

At that
point, it is important that the reader is able to reproduce your
work~\cite{schwab00,wavelab,gentleman05}. This is why it is also
important that if the work has a computational component, the software
associated with producing the results are also made available in a
useful form. Several guidelines for making your user's experience with
your software as painless as possible is given in
Section~\ref{sec:tips-software}.

Finally, we describe the rules for submission in the computational
intelligence laboratory in Section~\ref{sec:cil}. 
This brief guide is by no means sufficient, on its own, to
make its reader an accomplished writer. The reader is urged to use the
references to further improve his or her writing skills.
